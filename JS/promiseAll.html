        // Promise.all()
        // It takes an array of promises as input and returns a single promise.
        // The returned promise resolves when all of the input promises have resolved, 
        // and rejects if any of the input promises reject.
        // The resolved value of the Promise.all() is an array of the resolved values of the input promises, 
        // in the same order as the input promises.
        // If any of the input promises reject, the Promise.all() promise will reject with the reason of the first rejected promise.
        // If the input array is empty, the Promise.all() promise will resolve immediately.
        // Promise.all() is useful when you want to wait for multiple promises to resolve before continuing with the rest of your code.
        // For example, if you have a list of URLs that you want to fetch data from, you can use Promise.all() to wait for all of the requests to complete before processing the data.
        // Promise.all() is a powerful tool for working with asynchronous code in JavaScript.
        // It allows you to write more concise and readable code by eliminating the need for nested callbacks and complex error handling.

        // Promise.all([task1, task2, task3])

        // If any of the input promises reject, the Promise.all() promise will reject with the reason of the first rejected promise.
        // If the input array is empty, the Promise.all() promise will resolve immediately.

        // const task2 = Promise.resolve("Task 2  Completed ")
        // const task3 = Promise.resolve("Task 3  Completed ")

        // Promise.all([task1, task2, task3])
        //   .then( result => console.log(result)
        //   ).catch( error => console.log(error)
        //   )

     
        //  Promise.race([])
        // Promise.race() takes an array of promises as input and returns a single promise.
        // The returned promise settles (resolves or rejects) as soon as one of the input promises settles.
        // If the first promise to settle is resolved, the Promise.race() promise will resolve with the value of that promise.
        // If the first promise to settle is rejected, the Promise.race() promise will reject with the reason of that promise.
        // Promise.race() is useful when you want to wait for the first of multiple promises to settle.

        // Promise.race([task2, task1, task3])
        //   .then( result => console.log(result)

// Promise.any()
        // Promise.any() takes an array of promises as input and returns a single promise.
        // The returned promise settles (resolves or rejects) as soon as one of the input promises settles.
        // If the first promise to settle is resolved, the Promise.any() promise will resolve with the value of that promise.
        // If all of the input promises reject, the Promise.any() promise will reject with an AggregateError, 
        // which is a special type of error that contains an array of the reasons for the rejections.
        // Promise.any() is useful when you want to wait for the first of multiple promises to settle.
        // For example, if you have a list of URLs that you want to fetch data from, you can use Promise.any() to wait for the first request to complete before processing the data.
